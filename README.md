        <h1>My First Code Experience</h1>
        <p>Creating my first code was an exhilarating journey. The seminar conducted by my college provided the perfect platform to dive into the world of web development. I learned how to structure a webpage using HTML and style it with CSS. The process was challenging yet incredibly rewarding, and it sparked a passion for coding that I am excited to continue exploring.</p>
